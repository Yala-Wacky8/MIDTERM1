<tr rowspan="5"><p>Badoc was established as a pueblo (town) in 1714 by the Augustinian friars. It is believed that the late founding of the town of Badoc was due to the unsettled  peace and security conditions of the place at the time. 'the Badoc Island, known as “Puro," situated about two kilometers seaward from the coastline of the coastal barangay, Paguetpet, was said to be the favorite haven or hangout of fierce and hostile Moro and Zambal marauders. They stayed long in the island, because they were afraid to move out to neigh-boring towns which had good security forces.

    These ruthless marauders raided repeatedly the undisturbed villages south of the port of Gaang , Curimao, refraining from moving north near Paoay, whose security force could be strengthened easily and aided by those from Batac. Their stay greatly contributed to the delay in the establishment of the town. It was only after the pirate marauders moved out that the town was deemed officially founded.
            
    The establishment of the town as a parish in 1714 was also the approximate start of the construction of the Spanish built Catholic church, known as the Saint John the Baptist Church . It is said that the place of the Isneg settlement, wherein the first Spanish missionary team also established camp, was the seat of the Christianization of the town. This explains why the name Canaan , meaning "refuge of new Christians" was given to the area. It was also in the place where the church was established and where the first mass was said by Padre de Alvarado, an Augustinian priest who was the spiritual adviser of the expedition led by the youthful Spanish conquistador, Juan de Salcedo. The first mass, which was celebrated on June 24, 1572, or more than two centuries before the construction of the Catholic church, was said in thanks-giving for the peace treaty between Salcedo and the native leaders and was also dedicated to those who were slain in battle It coincided with the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, who was made Badoc's patron saint.
            
    Before the coming of the Spanish colonizers, the place was inhabited by some Isneg families. These were the earliest settlers and they established their huts in a clearing called Canaan , situated along the bank of the brook which was known as Pagdanuman (water source). All around the settlement was a thick growth of a native weed known to the settlers as bado-badoc. This weed was very valuable to the Itnegs, because its flowers, dipped in oil ex­tracted by cooking process from the kernel of the bittaog (palomaria) fruit, was used to light their huts at night and the stem and elongated leaves were used in making the walls and fences of their homes.
            
    In 1572, the Spaniards conducted intensive Christianization missions and Spanish soldiers were cruising along the Pagdanuman Brook, looking for a clearing wherein they could put up their camp when they came upon the Isneg settlement, In a very friendly manner, they approached the native settlers and requested that they be allowed to make camp near their settlement. But this could only be made possible by clearing an area of the thick growth of the Badoc-badoc weeds.
            
    Because of the language barrier, the Spaniards signified their intention by the use of signs. The soldiers pointed to the area that they desired to weed out for their camp site, At the same time, they signalled their request for help in the clearing activities. Unable to understand what the Spaniards desired, and believing that they merely wanted to know the name of the weed, the leader of the settlement swung one of his arms while pointing to the thick growth and said: "Bado-badoc, bado-badoc." The leader of the team recorded these words; hence, the town was called Badoc.
            
    Later, in accordance with an understanding made between the settlers and the missionaries. the area adjacent to the Isneg settlement was cleared of the bado-badoc weed. In spite of the good intentions of the missionary team, that was to make camp and have a center for their Christianization operations, the Isneg families became wary and suspicious due to the presence of armed Spanish soldiers. One night, under the cover of darkness, the entire Isneg group moved out eastward until they reached Ugis, a barangay of the town of Nueva Era ,which is adjacent to the easternmost barangay of Badoc and made their own settlement in the area. Up to this time, the Isneg still live in Ugis.</p></tr>
