        <h3>LA VIRGEN MILAGROSA DE BADOC</h3>
        <p>The revered image of La Virgen Milagrosa de Badoc, said to be 400 years old, is enshrined in the Church of St. John the Baptist Parish in Badoc, Ilocos Norte.

            The story of its origin begins in the year 1620 when some fishermen, fishing in the cove off the village of Lago, Dadalaquiten, bordering Sinait, Ilocos Sur and Badoc, Ilocos Norte, found two large wooden boxes floating on the ocean.
            
            A large crowd of townsfolk from Sinait and Badoc arrived at the scene gathering around the mysterious boxes and were astounded by the contents. One box contained the statue of the Black Cristo Milagroso and the other box contained the statue of the Blessed Virgin with the Infant Jesus in her arms accompanied by two statuettes of angels and a violin.
            
            A heated argument between the Sinait and Badoc fishermen who found the boxes ensued. A fascinating legend gives a uniquely inspiring story of this event. The dispute was later on settled amicably by what seemed like a divine power deciding their destiny. Hence, the Black Santo Cristo was enshrined in Sinait and the Blessed Virgin was enshrined in Badoc.
            
            It is believed that the image of the Blessed Virgin was brought to the town of Badoc as a reward to the Ilocanos for their fervid devotion and veneration of the Blessed Virgin. Countless miracles have since been attributed to her.
            
            In a Eucharistic Celebration on May 20, 1980, she was proclaimed La Virgen Milagrosa, Cause of our Joy, Patroness of Ilocos Norte and was canonically crowned in December of the same year. To commemorate this joyful event, an annual concelebrated mass is officiated by the Bishop of the Diocese of Laoag attended by devotees from the province and other neighboring provinces.</p>

        <h3>Luna Shrine</h3>
        <p>Juan Luna Shrine: Juan Luna Shrine is a two-storey brick house. It was the birthplace of Juan Luna. It is now converted into a repository for Juan Luna's memorabilia and a few paintings preserved to commemorate the legacy of the illustrious painter. His most famous painting is the Spoliarium which won the gold medal in the Madrid Exposition in 1884. The masterpiece is now under the custody of the National Museum in Manila.

        A glimpse to the Spoliarium: The award winning masterpiece, the Spoliarium, is a huge canvas depicting dying gladiators. The gigantic size of Luna's masterpiece of oil on poplar gives pride to Filipinos. Through the Spoliarium, the Filipino genius had been recognized worldwide since it was able to compete and triumph in the international scene. This achievement proved to the world that "indios" could, despite their supposed barbarian race, paint better than the Spaniards.</p>

The gentleness of the waves of the ocean makes the floating cottage swinging with calmness that made us to enjoy the picnic in the La Milagrosa or “Miracolous” beach.
