        -“kilawen a susay “ one of the most awaited dishes of Badocuenios is served as an appetizer and even a main dish to us . Since our house is near the ocean we are fond of eating fishes and to have a twist and a substitute to a goat meat we made our own version of kilawin but the main ingredients is susay flavoured by salt, pepper, garlic, chili, vinegar and calamansi. “TASTE GOOD” good for people who are prone to hypertension.
